# Task 1 - Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

This project is the first task in a machine learning pipeline: preprocessing raw data to prepare it for model training. The dataset used is related to stock prices.

## 📝 Objective

To preprocess a raw dataset to make it ready for machine learning. This includes:

- ✅ Handling missing data (e.g., filling with mean and dropping columns)
- ✅ Encoding categorical variable (using one-hot encoding )
- ✅ Normalizing or standardizing numerical features
- ✅ Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `Stock_Prices.csv`: The raw dataset.
- `model_2.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire preprocessing pipeline.
- `__init__.py`: Empty file for module initialization (optional for Python packaging).

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.13.5**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🚀 Steps Covered

1. **Importing the dataset**
2. **Handling missing values**
3. **Encoding categorical variables**
4. **Feature scaling** – Normalization/Standardization
5. **Splitting into training and test sets**

## 📌 Usage

To run this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Debaswini-M/Task_1-Data-Preprocessing.git
cd Task_1-Data-Preprocessing
jupyter notebook model_2.ipynb
